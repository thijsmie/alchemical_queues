I Have a Question If you want to ask a question, we assume that you have read the available Documentation . Before you ask a question, it is best to search for existing Issues that might help you. In case you have found a suitable issue and still need clarification, you can write your question in this issue. It is also advisable to search the internet for answers first. If you then still feel the need to ask a question and need clarification, we recommend the following: Open an Issue . Provide as much context as you can about what you're running into. Provide project and platform versions (nodejs, npm, etc), depending on what seems relevant. We will then take care of the issue as soon as possible. I Want To Contribute Legal Notice When contributing to this project, you must agree that you have authored 100% of the content, that you have the necessary rights to the content and that the content you contribute may be provided under the project license (MIT). Reporting Bugs Before Submitting a Bug Report A good bug report shouldn't leave others needing to chase you up for more information. Therefore, we ask you to investigate carefully, collect information and describe the issue in detail in your report. Please complete the following steps in advance to help us fix any potential bug as fast as possible. Make sure that you are using the latest version. Determine if your bug is really a bug and not an error on your side e.g. using incompatible environment components/versions (Make sure that you have read the documentation . If you are looking for support, you might want to check this section ). To see if other users have experienced (and potentially already solved) the same issue you are having, check if there is not already a bug report existing for your bug or error in the bug tracker . Also make sure to search the internet (including Stack Overflow) to see if users outside of the GitHub community have discussed the issue. Collect information about the bug: Stack trace (Traceback) OS, Platform and Version (Windows, Linux, macOS, x86, ARM) Version of the interpreter, compiler, SDK, runtime environment, package manager, depending on what seems relevant. Possibly your input and the output Can you reliably reproduce the issue? And can you also reproduce it with older versions? How Do I Submit a Good Bug Report? You must never report security related issues, vulnerabilities or bugs including sensitive information to the issue tracker, or elsewhere in public. Instead sensitive bugs must be sent by email to open-source@tmiedema.com . We use GitHub issues to track bugs and errors. If you run into an issue with the project: Open an Issue . (Since we can't be sure at this point whether it is a bug or not, we ask you not to talk about a bug yet and not to label the issue.) Explain the behavior you would expect and the actual behavior. Please provide as much context as possible and describe the reproduction steps that someone else can follow to recreate the issue on their own. This usually includes your code. For good bug reports you should isolate the problem and create a reduced test case. Provide the information you collected in the previous section. Once it's filed: The project team will label the issue accordingly. A team member will try to reproduce the issue with your provided steps. If there are no reproduction steps or no obvious way to reproduce the issue, the team will ask you for those steps and mark the issue as needs-repro . Bugs with the needs-repro tag will not be addressed until they are reproduced. If the team is able to reproduce the issue, it will be marked needs-fix , as well as possibly other tags (such as critical ), and the issue will be left to be implemented by someone . Suggesting Enhancements This section guides you through submitting an enhancement suggestion for Alchemical Queues, including completely new features and minor improvements to existing functionality . Following these guidelines will help maintainers and the community to understand your suggestion and find related suggestions. Before Submitting an Enhancement Make sure that you are using the latest version. Read the documentation carefully and find out if the functionality is already covered, maybe by an individual configuration. Perform a search to see if the enhancement has already been suggested. If it has, add a comment to the existing issue instead of opening a new one. Find out whether your idea fits with the scope and aims of the project. It's up to you to make a strong case to convince the project's developers of the merits of this feature. Keep in mind that we want features that will be useful to the majority of our users and not just a small subset. If you're just targeting a minority of users, consider writing an add-on/plugin library. How Do I Submit a Good Enhancement Suggestion? Enhancement suggestions are tracked as GitHub issues . Use a clear and descriptive title for the issue to identify the suggestion. Provide a step-by-step description of the suggested enhancement in as many details as possible. Describe the current behavior and explain which behavior you expected to see instead and why. At this point you can also tell which alternatives do not work for you. Explain why this enhancement would be useful to most Alchemical Queues users. You may also want to point out the other projects that solved it better and which could serve as inspiration. Your First Code Contribution So you've decided to contribute some code to Alchemical Queues! Here a couple quick steps to get your environment up and running. The environment used for Alchemical Queues is managed by poetry , a very useful tool that makes setting up the same environment every time a breeze. Install it easily via pip: $ pip install poetry Now you can clone the github repository (maybe make a fork first) and install the dependencies. $ git clone https://github.com/thijsmie/alchemical_queues $ cd alchemical_queues $ poetry install You can now make a change somewhere. For the sake of argument, lets just say you add a quick print(\"Hi!\") somewhere in the code. Before you contribute this change back to the project you'll need to perform a couple steps: Format your code with black Alchemical Queues is formatted using black , a zero-config code formatter. Run it like so: $ poetry run black src/ Rate your code style using pylint To make sure there aren't any unused imports, non-descriptive variable names or other such \"code smells\" you can run pylint . $ poetry run pylint src/alchemical_queues/ Preferably, the rating should stay '10.0', unless there is a compelling reason not to. Type-check your code with mypy Type hints are an important way to communicate to the user how the Alchemical Queues API works. Use mypy to check it: $ poetry run mypy . Run the testsuite with pytest Testing is important, and it helps you to not accidentally break the code. We test using pytest . It also gives some feedback on coverage , which counts how many lines of your code are actually tested. $ poetry run pytest --cov = src . $ poetry run coverage report Attribution This guide is based on the contributing-gen .

For this tutorial we will use a SQLite database but you can use whatever you already have. from sqlalchemy import create_engine engine = create_engine ( f \"sqlite:///test.db\" ) We can now initialize the Alchemical Queues manager object on this engine. This will initialize some SQLAlchemy metadata on the engine. from alchemical_queues import AlchemicalQueues queues = AlchemicalQueues ( engine ) queues . create_all () If you're used to Flask-SQLAlchemy: queues.create_all is like db.create_all . For the pure SQLAlchemy users, it is like metadata.create_all . It is creating the tables Alchemical Queues uses to store the queues and response data. Queues The Queues in Alchemical Queues are named and distributed. They are thread and interprocess-safe. By being powered by a database and not something \"smarter\" they are not the fastest, but they are as reliable as the database backend powering them. Let's obtain a named AlchemicalQueue and push some data to it: queue = queues . get ( \"test-queue\" ) queue . put ( 42 ) queue . put ( 137 ) We can now run a second script to read back what we put in: print ( queue . get () . data ) # prints 42 print ( queue . get () . data ) # prints 137 Note that entries are returned in the same order as we put them in. The Queue is a so called FIFO Queue: first-in, first-out. Secondly, note that we access the .data attribute of what is returned, and not the data returned directly. Unlike the standard library queue.Queue the items are not returned as-is but have some additional information. What is returned is a AlchemicalEntry which has several other properties. This entry is also returned when you put something into the queue. entry1 = queue . put ( 12 ) entry2 = queue . get () # entry1 and entry2 represent the same entry What types of data are allowed in a Queue? Data you put in a Queue is serialized to bytes using pickle . Any pickle able datatype is allowed. Tasks Implemented on top of AlchemicalQueues is a Task Queue implementation like celery . If you want to have a robust task queue with lots of features I would definitely recommend celery instead. However, alchemical_queues.tasks has the advantage of just needing SQLite to run, thus not requiring any installation of Redis or RabbitMQ or other broker. Running a worker is just another Python script. We first define the task to run as a python function. This task function must be importable by the worker, so for the example put it in a file tasks.py in your working directory. from alchemical_queues.tasks import task @task def add_numbers ( taskinfo , a , b ): return a + b The first argument to any task function is the taskinfo. It is sort of like the celery current_task containing some basic info.

Make sure it can import add_numbers by using the same working directory.
